# Description:-

- Student Enrollment Form stores the data in STUDENT-TABLE relation of SCHOOL-DB database.

- Input Fields: {Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, Enrollment-Date}

On page load or any control button click, an empty form will be displayed and the cursor will remain at the first input field in the form which will have the primary key in the relation. All other fields and buttons should be disabled at this time.
